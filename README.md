# InTime - An Overview
InTime is a web-based project created by Rachelle Phipps, Katie Carbonell, and Skyler Riggle for CS-3203 Software Engineering. The application is designed to deliver its user information related to the timeline of company's interview process (with an emphasis on tech related internships). We have done this by creating a backend server to interface with data related to the site and timelines. We have also created a nice frontend interface application for users to interact with our site.
